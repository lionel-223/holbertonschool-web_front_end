- All SCSS files should include a comment at the beginning (syntax provided below)
- Each file should start with a comment describing the task
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is **mandatory**

## More Info
### Comments for your SCSS files:
All SCSS files must start with a comment block, following this format:

*/
```

## Getting Started

```

To watch a file for changes and automatically recompile:

```sh
sass --watch input.scss:output.css
```
